* the same time, you might get better performance by managing loading
* yourself. The smartest way to do this, bearing in mind performance,
* is probably to "load on demand" - i.e. just before you use these
* functions in your code, load the version you need.
*
* It makes sure the the following functions are available;
* utf8_strlen, utf8_strpos, utf8_strrpos, utf8_substr,
* utf8_strtolower, utf8_strtoupper
* Other functions in the ./native directory depend on these
* six functions being available
