		<title>Dave Winer: Grateful Dead</title>
		<link>http://www.scripting.com/blog/categories/gratefulDead.html</link>
		<description>A high-fidelity Grateful Dead song every day. This is where we're experimenting with enclosures on RSS news items that download when you're not using your computer. If it works (it will) it will be the end of the Click-And-Wait multimedia experience on the Internet. </description>

			<description>It's been a few days since I added a song to the Grateful Dead channel. Now that there are all these new Radio users, many of whom are tuned into this channel (it's #16 on the hotlist of upstreaming Radio users, there's no way of knowing how many non-upstreaming users are subscribing, have to do something about this..). Anyway, tonight's song is a live version of Weather Report Suite from Dick's Picks Volume 7. It's wistful music. Of course a beautiful song, oft-quoted here on Scripting News. &lt;i&gt;A little change, the wind and rain.&lt;/i&gt;

			<description>Moshe Weitzman says Shakedown Street is what I'm lookin for for tonight. I'm listening right now. It's one of my favorites. "Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart." Too bright. I like the jazziness of Weather Report Suite. Dreamy and soft. How about The Other One? "Spanish lady come to me.."</description>

			<description>Still listening to the US Blues. &lt;i&gt;"Wave that flag, wave it wide and high.."&lt;/i&gt; Mistake made in the 60s. We gave our country to the assholes. Ah ah. Let's take it back. Hey I'm still a hippie. &lt;i&gt;"You could call this song The United States Blues."&lt;/i&gt;</description>

It made my choice of Grateful Dead song of the night realllly easy. Here are the &lt;a href="http://searchlyrics2.homestead.com/gd_usblues.html"&gt;lyrics&lt;/a&gt;. Click on the audio icon to the left to give it a listen. "Red and white, blue suede shoes, I'm Uncle Sam, how do you do?" It's a different kind of patriotic music, but man I love my country and I love Jerry and the band. &lt;i&gt;I truly do!&lt;/i&gt;</description>

			<description>Ed Cone: "Had a nice Deadhead experience with my wife, who never was one but gets the vibe and knows and likes a lot of the music. Somehow she made it to the age of 40 without ever hearing Wharf Rat. We drove to Jersey and back over Christmas with the live album commonly known as Skull and Roses in the CD player much of the way, and it was cool to see her discover one the band's finest moments. That song is unique and underappreciated. Fun to hear that disc again after a few years off -- you get Jerry as blues-guitar hero on Big Railroad Blues and a nice version of Bertha."</description>
