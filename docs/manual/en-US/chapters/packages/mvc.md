## The Model-View-Controller Packages

### Introduction

Version 12.1 of the platform introduced a new format for
model-view-controller paradigm. Principly, the classes `JModel`, `JView` and
`JController` are now interfaces and the base abstract classes are now
`JModelBase`, `JViewBase` and `JControllerBase` respectively. In additional,
all classes have been simplified removing a lot of coupling with the
Joomla CMS that is unnecessary for standalone Joomla Platform
applications.

All the API for controllers, models and views has moved from the
Application package into separate Controller, Model and View packages
respectively. Much of the API previously devoted to adding include paths
for each of the classes has been removed because of improvements in the
auto-loader or by registering or discovering classes explicitly using
JLoader.

Controllers only support one executable task per class via the execute
method. This differs from the legacy `JController` class which mapped
tasks to methods in a single class. Messages and redirection are not
always required so have been dropped in this base class. They can be
provided in a downstream class to suit individual applications.
Likewise, methods to create models and views have been dropped in favor
of using application or package factory classes.

Models have been greatly simplified in comparison to their legacy
counterpart. The base model is nothing more than a class to hold state.
All database support methods have been dropped except for database
object support in `JModelDatabase`. Extended model classes such as
`JModelAdmin`, `JModelForm`, `JModelItem` and `JModelList` are part of the
legacy platform.

Views have also been greatly simplified. Views are now injected with a
single model and a controller. Magic get methods have been dropped in
favor of using the model directly. Similarly, assignment methods have
also been dropped in favor of setting class properties explicitly. The
`JViewHtml` class still implements layout support albeit in a simplified
manner.

### Interfaces

#### JController

`JController` is an interface that requires a class to be implemented with
an `execute`, a `getApplication` and a `getInput` method.

#### JModel

`JModel` is an interface that requires a class to be implemented with a
`getState` and a `setState` method.

#### JView

`JView` is an interface that requires a class to be implemented with an
`escape` and a `render` method.

### Classes

#### JControllerBase

##### Construction

The constructor for `JControllerBase` takes an optional `JInput` object and
an optional `JApplciationBase` object. If either is omitted, the
constructor defers to the protected `loadInput` and `loadApplication`
methods respectively. These methods can be overriden in derived classes
if the default application and request input is not appropriate.

##### Usage

The `JControllerBase` class is abstract so cannot be used directly. The
derived class must implement the execute method to satisfy the interface
requirements. Note that the execute method no longer takes a "task"
argument as each controller class. Multi-task controllers are still
possible by overriding the execute method in derived classes. Each
controller class should do just one sort of 'thing', such as saving,
deleting, checking in, checking out and so on. However, controllers, or
even models and views, have the liberty of invoking other controllers to
allow for HMVC architectures.

```php
/**
 * My custom controller.
 *
 * @package  Examples
 *
 * @since   12.1
 */
class MyController extends JControllerBase
{
	/**
	 * Method to execute the controller.
	 *
	 * @return  void
	 *
	 * @since   12.1
	 * @throws  RuntimeException
	 */
	public function execute()
	{
		echo time();
	}
}

// Instantiate the controller.
$controller = new MyController;

// Print the time.
$controller->execute();
```

##### Serialization

The `JControllerBase` class implements `Serializable`. When serializing,
only the input property is serialized. When unserializing, the input
variable is unserialized and the internal application property is loaded
at runtime.

#### JModelBase

##### Construction

The contructor for `JModelBase` takes an optional `JRegistry` object that
defines the state of the model. If omitted, the contructor defers to the
protected `loadState` method. This method can be overriden in a derived
class and takes the place of the `populateState` method used in the legacy
model class.

##### Usage

The `JModelBase` class is abstract so cannot be used directly. All
requirements of the interface are already satisfied by the base class.

```php
/**
 * My custom model.
 *
 * @pacakge  Examples
 *
 * @since   12.1
 */
class MyModel extends JModelBase
{
	/**
	 * Get the time.
	 *
	 * @return  integer
	 *
	 * @since   12.1
	 */
	public function getTime()
	{
		return time();
	}
}
```

#### JModelDatabase

##### Construction

`JModelDatabase` is extended from `JModelBase` and the contructor takes an
optional `JDatabaseDriver` object and an optional `JRegistry` object (the
same one that `JModelBase` uses). If the database object is omitted, the
contructor defers to the protected `loadDb` method which loads the
database object from the platform factory.

##### Usage

The `JModelDatabase` class is abstract so cannot be used directly. It
forms a base for any model that needs to interact with a database.

```php
/**
 * My custom database model.
 *
 * @package  Examples
 *
 * @since   12.1
 */
class MyDatabaseModel extends JModelDatabase
{
	/**
	 * Get the content count.
	 *
	 * @return  integer
	 *
	 * @since   12.1
	 * @throws  RuntimeException on database error.
	 */
	public function getCount()
	{
		// Get the query builder from the internal database object.
		$q = $this->db->getQuery(true);

		// Prepare the query to count the number of content records.
		$q->select('COUNT(*)')->from($q->qn('#__content'));

		$this->db->setQuery($q);

		// Execute and return the result.
		return $this->db->loadResult();
	}
}

try
{
	$model = new MyDatabaseModel;
	$count = $model->getCount();
}
catch (RuntimeException $e)
{
	// Handle database error.
}
```

#### JViewBase

##### Construction

The contructor for `JViewBase` takes a mandatory `JModel` parameter.

Note that `JModel` is an interface so the actual object passed does
necessarily have to extend from `JModelBase` class. Given that, the view
should only rely on the API that is exposed by the interface and not
concrete classes unless the contructor is changed in a derived class to
take more explicit classes or interaces as required by the developer.

##### Usage

The `JViewBase` class is abstract so cannot be used directly. It forms a
simple base for rendering any kind of data. The class already implements
the escape method so only a render method need to be added. Views
derived from this class would be used to support very simple cases, well
suited to supporting web services returning JSON, XML or possibly binary
data types. This class does not support layouts.

```php
/**
 * My custom view.
 *
 * @package  Examples
 *
 * @since   12.1
 */
class MyView extends JViewBase
{
	/**
	 * Render some data
	 *
	 * @return  string  The rendered view.
	 *
	 * @since   12.1
	 * @throws  RuntimeException on database error.
	 */
	public function render()
	{
		// Prepare some data from the model.
		$data = array('count' => $this->model->getCount());

		// Convert the data to JSON format.
		return json_encode($data);
	}
}

try
{
	$view = new MyView(new MyDatabaseModel());
	echo $view->render();
}
catch (RuntimeException $e)
{
	// Handle database error.
}
```

#### JViewHtml

##### Construction

`JViewHtml` is extended from `JViewBase`. The constructor, in addition to
the required model argument, take an optional `SplPriorityQueue` object
that serves as a lookup for layouts. If omitted, the view defers to the
protected loadPaths method.

##### Usage

The `JViewHtml` class is abstract so cannot be used directly. This view
class implements render. It will try to find the layout, include it
using output buffering and return the result. The following examples
show a layout file that is assumed to be stored in a generic layout
folder not stored under the web-server root.

```php
<?php
/**
 * Example layout "layouts/count.php".
 *
 * @package  Examples
 * @since    12.1
 */

// Declare variables to support type hinting.

/** @var $this MyHtmlView */
?>

<dl>
	<dt>Count</dt>
	<dd><?php echo $this->model->getCount(); ?></dd>
</dl>
```

```php
/**
 * My custom HTML view.
 *
 * @package  Examples
 * @since    12.1
 */
class MyHtmlView extends JViewHtml
{
	/**
	 * Redefine the model so the correct type hinting is available in the layout.
	 *
	 * @var     MyDatabaseModel
	 * @since   12.1
	 */
	protected $model;
}

try
{
	$paths = new SplPriorityQueue;
	$paths->insert(__DIR__ . '/layouts');

	$view = new MyView(new MyDatabaseModel, $paths);
	$view->setLayout('count');
	echo $view->render();

	// Alternative approach.
	$view = new MyView(new MyDatabaseModel);

	// Use some chaining.
	$view->setPaths($paths)->setLayout('count');

	// Take advantage of the magic __toString method.
	echo $view;
}
catch (RuntimeException $e)
{
	// Handle database error.
}
```

The default extension for layouts is ".php". This can be modified in derived views by changing the default value for the extension argument. For example:

```php
/**
 * My custom HTML view.
 *
 * @package  Examples
 * @since    12.1
 */
class MyHtmlView extends JViewHtml
{
	/**
	 * Override the parent method to use the '.phtml' extension for layout files.
	 *
	 * @param   string  $layout  The base name of the layout file (excluding extension).
	 * @param   string  $ext     The extension of the layout file (default: "phtml").
	 *
	 * @return  mixed  The layout file name if found, false otherwise.
	 *
	 * @see     JViewHtml::getPath
	 * @since   12.1
	 */
	public function getPath($layout, $ext = 'phtml')
	{
		return parent::getPath($layout, $ext);
	}
}
```

##### Revision history

The new View package was added in 12.1.

The extension argument was added to `JViewHtml->getPath` in 12.3.
