  <title>JLoader</title>

  <para>JLoader is the mainstay of the Joomla Platform as it controls auto-loading of classes. Wherever possible, class names and
  paths should conform to the auto-loader convention in the form:</para>

  <simplelist>
    <member><classname>JClassname</classname> located in <filename>JPATH_PLATFORM/joomla/classname/classname.php</filename>,
    or</member>

    <member><classname>JPathtoClassname</classname> located in
    <filename>JPATH_PLATFORM/joomla/pathto/classname.php</filename></member>
  </simplelist>

  <para>However, deviations, and even overrides can be handled by <classname>JLoader</classname>'s register and discover
  methods.</para>

  <para></para>

  <section>
    <title>Registering Classes</title>

    <para>New classes, or override classes can be registered using the <methodname>register</methodname> method. This method takes
    the class name, the path to the class file, and an option boolean to force an update of the class register.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Using JLoader::register</title>

      <programlisting>// Register an adhoc class.
JLoader::register('AdhocClass', '/the/path/adhoc.php');

// Register a custom class to override as core class.
// This must be done before the core class is loaded.
JLoader::register('JDatabase', '/custom/path/database_driver.php', true);</programlisting>
    </example>

  <section>
    <title>Registering a Class Prefix</title>

    <para>Since 12.1, there is the ability to register where the auto-loader will look based on a class prefix (previously only
    the "J" prefix was supported, bound to the <filename>/libraries/joomla</filename> folder). This allows for several
    scenarios:</para>

    <simplelist>
      <member>A developer can register the prefix of custom classes, and a root path to allow the auto-loader to find
      them.</member>

      <member>A developer can register an extra path for an existing prefix (for example, this allows the Joomla CMS to have
      custom libraries but still using the "J" prefix).</member>

      <member>A developer can register a force override for a prefix. This could be used to completely override the core classes
      with a custom replacement.</member>
    </simplelist>

    <example>
      <title>Using JLoader::registerPrefix</title>

      <programlisting>// Tell the auto-loader to also look in the /libraries/cms folder for "J" prefixed classes.
JLoader::registerPrefix('J', JPATH_PLATFORM . '/cms');

// Tell the auto-loader to look for classes starting with "Foo" in a specific folder.
JLoader::registerPrefix('Foo', '/path/to/custom/packages');

// Tell the auto-loader to reset the "J" prefix and point it to a custom fork of the platform.
JLoader::registerPrefix('J', '/my/platform/fork', true);</programlisting>
    </example>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Discovering Classes</title>

    <para>Classes in a folder that follow a naming convention, but not one the auto-loader immediately recognises, can be
    registered collectively with <classname>JLoader</classname>'s <methodname>discover</methodname> method. The discover method
    looks at the file names in a folder and registers classes based on those names. Additional arguments can be used to update the
    class register and recurse into sub-folders.</para>

    <example>
      <title>Using JLoader::discover</title>

      <programlisting>// Register all files in the /the/path/ folder as classes with a name like:
// Prefix&lt;Filename&gt;
JLoader::discover('Prefix', '/the/path/');</programlisting>
    </example>
