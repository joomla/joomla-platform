  <title>Source Code Management</title>

  <para>Before we start talking about what code should look like, it is appropriate to look at how and where the source code is
  stored. All serious software projects, whether driven by an Open Source community or developed within a company for
  proprietary purposes will manage the source code is some sort of source or version management system. Joomla currently employs
  two different systems. One system is for the files that form the product distributed as the Joomla CMS, and the other is for
  the files that are distributed as the Joomla Platform. Each system is described below.</para>

    <title>The Joomla Platform</title>

    <para>In April 2011 the Joomla project decided to formally split off the core engine that drives the Joomla CMS into a
    separate project with a separate development path called the Joomla Platform. The Joomla Platform is a PHP framework that is
    designed to serve as a foundation for not only web applications (like a CMS) but other types of software such as command line
    applications. The files that form the Joomla Platform are stored in a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) called Git
    hosted at github.org</para>

    <para>You can learn about how to get the Joomla Platform source code from the Git repository from the following page:
    &lt;permalink to developer.joomla.org staging page&gt;</para>

    <para>Because Git treats the concepts of file revision numbers differently than Subversion, the repository revision number is
    not required in files (that is, the @version tag is not necessary).</para>

    <title>Compliance Tool</title>

    <para>TODO Mention something about CodeSniffer and the custom Joomla sniff standard for PHP files. The Sniff is based on the
    standard outlined in this document. For more information about how code standards are enforced see the analysis appendix of
    the manual.</para>
