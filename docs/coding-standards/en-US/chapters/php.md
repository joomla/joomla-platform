This chapter is about ...

Language Constructs
===================

PHP Code Tags
-------------

Always use the full \<?php ?\> to delimit PHP code, not the \<? ?\>
shorthand. This is the most portable way to include PHP code on
differing operating systems and setups.

For files that contain only PHP code, the closing tag (?\>) should not
be included. It is not required by PHP. Leaving this out prevents
trailing white space from being accidentally injected into the output
that can introduce errors in the Joomla session (see the PHP manual on
[Instruction
separation](http://php.net/basic-syntax.instruction-separation).

Files should always end with a blank new line.

TODO Example

Including Code
--------------

Anywhere you are unconditionally including a file, use require\_once.
Anywhere you are conditionally including a file (for example, factory
methods), use include\_once. Either of these will ensure that files are
included only once. They share the same file list, so you don't need to
worry about mixing them. A file included with require\_once will not be
included again by include\_once.

> **Note**
>
> include\_once and require\_once are PHP language statements, not
> functions. The correct formatting is:
>
> `require_once JPATH_COMPONENT.’/helpers/helper.php’;`

You should not enclose the filename in parentheses.

E\_STRICT Compatible PHP Code
-----------------------------

As of Joomla version 1.6 and for all versions of the Joomla Platform,
adhering to object oriented programming practice as supported by PHP 5.2
is required. Joomla is committed to progressively making the source code
E\_STRICT.

Global Variables
================

TODO Usage should be kept to a minimum. Use OOP and factory patterns
instead.

Control Structures
==================

For all control structures there is a space between the keyword and an
opening parenthesis, then no space either after the opening parenthesis
or before the closing bracket. This is done to distinguish control
keywords from function names. All control structures must contain their
logic within braces.

For all all control structures, such as if, else, do, for, foreach, try,
catch, switch and while, both the keyword starts a newline and the
opening and closing braces are each put on a new line.

An if-else Example
------------------

    if ($test)
    {
        echo 'True';
    }
    // Comments can go here.
    // Note that "elseif" as one word is used.
    elseif ($test === false)
    {
        echo 'Really false';
    }
    else
    {
        echo 'A white lie';
    }

If a control structure goes over multiple lines, all lines must be
indented with one tab and the closing brace must go on the same line as
the last parameter.

    if ($test1
        && $test2)
    {
        echo 'True';
    }

A do-while Example
------------------

    do
    {
        $i++;
    }
    while ($i < 10);

A for Example
-------------

    for ($i = 0; $i < $n; $i++)
    {
        echo 'Increment = '.$i;
    }

A foreach Example
-----------------

    foreach ($rows as $index => $row)
    {
        echo 'Index = '.$id.', Value = '.$row;
    }

A while Example
---------------

    while (!$done)
    {
        $done = true;
    }

A switch example
----------------

When using a switch statement, the case keywords are indented. The break
statement starts on a newline assuming the indent of the code within the
case.

    switch ($value)
    {
        case 'a':
            echo 'A';
            break;

        default:
            echo 'I give up';
            break;
    }

References
----------

When using references, there should be a space before the reference
operator and no space between it and the function or variable name.

For example:

    <?php
    $ref1 = &$this->sql;

> **Note**
>
> In PHP 5, reference operators are not required for objects. All
> objects are handled by reference.

Arrays
------

Assignments (the =\> operator) in arrays may be aligned with tabs. When
splitting array definitions onto several lines, the last value may also
have a trailing comma. This is valid PHP syntax and helps to keep code
diffs minimal.

For example:

    $options = array(
        'foo'  => 'foo',
        'spam' => 'spam',
    );

Code Commenting
===============

Inline comments to explain code follow the convention for C (/\* … \*/)
and C++ single line (// ...) comments. C-style blocks are generally
restricted to documentation headers for files, classes and functions.
The C++ style is generally used for making code notes. Code notes are
strongly encouraged to help other people, including your future-self,
follow the purpose of the code. Always provide notes where the code is
performing particularly complex operations.

Perl/shell style comments (\#) are not permitted in PHP files but are
permitted in INI language files.

Blocks of code may, of course, be commented out for debugging purposes
using any appropriate format, but should be removed before submitting
patches for contribution back to the core code.

For example, do not include feature submissions like:

    <?php
    // Must fix this code up one day.
    //$code = broken($fixme);

Comment Docblocks
-----------------

Documentation headers for PHP and Javascript code in files, classes,
class properties, methods and functions, called the docblocks, follow a
convention similar to JavaDoc or phpDOC.

These "DocBlocks" borrow from the PEAR standard but have some variations
specific for Joomla and the Joomla Platform.

Whereas normal code indenting uses real tabs, all whitespace in a
Docblock uses real spaces. This provides better readability in source
code browsers. The minimum whitespace between any text elements, such as
tags, variable types, variable names and tag descriptions, is two real
spaces. Variable types and tag descriptions should be aligned according
to the longest Docblock tag and type-plus-variable respectively.

If the @package tag is used, it will be "Joomla.Platform".

If the @subpackage tag is used, it is the name of the top level folder
under the /joomla/ folder. For example: Application, Database, Html, and
so on.

Code contributed to the Joomla project that will become the copyright of
the project is not allowed to include @author tags. You should update
the contribution log in CREDITS.php. Joomla's philosophy is that the
code is written "all together" and there is no notion of any one person
"owning" any section of code. The @author tags are permitted in
third-party libraries that are included in the core libraries.

Files included from third party sources must leave DocBlocks intact.
Layout files use the same DocBlocks as other PHP files.

File DocBlock Headers
---------------------

The file header DocBlock consists of the following required and optional
elements in the following order:

-   Short description (optional unless the file contains more than two
    classes or functions), followed by a blank line).

-   Long description (optional, followed by a blank line).

-   @category (optional and rarely used)

-   @package (generally optional but required when files contain only
    procedural code)

-   @subpackage (optional)

-   @author (optional but only permitted in non-Joomla source files, for
    example, included third-party libraries like Geshi)

-   @copyright (required)

-   @license (required and must be compatible with the Joomla license)

-   @deprecated (optional)

-   @link (optional)

-   @see (optional)

-   @since (generally optional but required when files contain only
    procedural code)

<!-- -->

    <?php
    /**
     * @package     Joomla.Platform
     * @subpackage  Database
     * @copyright   Copyright 2005 - 2010 Open Source Matters. All rights re-served.
     * @license     GNU General Public License version 2 or later; see LICENSE.txt
     */

Function Calls
==============

Functions should be called with no spaces between the function name and
the opening parenthesis, and no space between this and the first
parameter; a space after the comma between each parameter (if they are
present), and no space between the last parameter and the closing
parenthesis. There should be space before and exactly one space after
the equals sign. Tab alignment over multiple lines is permitted.

    <?php
    // An isolated function call.
    $foo = bar($var1, $var2);

    // Multiple aligned function calls.
    $short   = bar('short');
    $medium  = bar('medium');
    $long    = bar('long');

Function Definitions
====================

Function definitions start on a new line and the opening and closing
braces are also placed on new lines. An empty line should precede lines
specifying the return value.

Function definitions must include a documentation comment in accordance
with the Commenting section of this document.

-   Short description (required, followed by a blank line)

-   Long description (optional, followed by a blank line)

-   @param (required if there are method or function arguments, the last
    @param tag is followed by a blank line)

-   @return (required, followed by a blank line)

-   All other tags in alphabetical order, however @since is always
    required.

<!-- -->

    <?php
    /**
     * A utility class.
     *
     * @package     Joomla.Platform
     * @subpackage  XBase
     *
     * @param       string  $path  The library path in dot notation.
     *
     * @return      void
     *
     * @since       1.6
     */
    function jimport($path)
    {
        // Body of method.
    }

If a function definition goes over multiple lines, all lines must be
indented with one tab and the closing brace must go on the same line as
the last parameter.

    function fooBar($param1, $param2,
       $param3, $param4)
    {
       // Body of method.
    }

Class Definitions
=================

Class definitions start on a new line and the opening and closing braces
are also placed on new lines. Class methods must follow the guidelines
for Function Definitions. Properties and methods must follow OOP
standards and be declared appropriately (using public, protected,
private and static as applicable).

Class definitions, properties and methods must each be provided with a
DocBlock in accordance with the following sections.

Class DocBlock Headers
----------------------

The class Docblock consists of the following required and optional
elements in the fol-lowing order.

-   Short description (required, unless the file contains more than two
    classes or functions), followed by a blank line).

-   Long description (optional, followed by a blank line).

-   @category (optional and rarely used)

-   @package (required)

-   @subpackage (optional)

-   @author (optional but only permitted in non-Joomla source files, for
    example, included third-party libraries like Geshi)

-   @copyright (optional unless different from the file Docblock)

-   @license (optional unless different from the file Docblock)

-   @deprecated (optional)

-   @link (optional)

-   @see (optional)

-   @since (required, being the version of the software the class was
    introduced)

Class Property DocBlocks
------------------------

The class property Docblock consists of the following required and
optional elements in the following order.

-   Short description (required, followed by a blank line)

-   @var (required, followed by the property type)

-   @deprecated (optional)

-   @since (required)

Class Method DocBlocks
----------------------

The DocBlock for class methods follows the same convention as for PHP
functions (see above).

    <?php
    /**
     * A utility class.
     *
     * @package     Joomla.Platform
     * @subpackage  XBase
     * @since       1.6
     */
    class JClass extends JObject
    {
        /**
         * Human readable name
         *
         * @var    string
         * @since  1.6
         */
        public $name;

        /**
         * Method to get the name of the class.
         *
         * @param   string  $case  Optionally return in upper/lower case.
         *
         * @return  boolean  True if successfully loaded, false otherwise.
         *
         * @since   1.6
         */
        public function getName($case = null)
        {
            // Body of method.

            return $this->name;
        }
    }

Naming Conventions
==================

Classes
-------

Classes should be given descriptive names. Avoid using abbreviations
where possible. Class names should always begin with an uppercase letter
and be written in CamelCase even if using traditionally uppercase
acronyms (such as XML, HTML). One exception is for Joomla framework
classes which must begin with an uppercase 'J' with the next letter also
being uppercase.

For example:

-   JHtmlHelper

-   JXmlParser

-   JModel

Functions and Methods
---------------------

Functions and methods should be named using the "studly caps" style
(also referred to as "bumpy case" or "camel caps"). The initial letter
of the name is lowercase, and each letter that starts a new "word" is
capitalized. Function in the Joomla framework must begin with a
lowercase 'j'.

For example:

-   connect();

-   getData();

-   buildSomeWidget();

-   jImport();

-   jDoSomething();

Private class members (meaning class members that are intended to be
used only from within the same class in which they are declared) are
preceded by a single underscore. Properties are to be written in
underscore format (that is, logical words separated by underscores) and
should be all lowercase.

For example:

    class JFooHelper
    {
        private $_status = null;

        protected $field_name = null;

        protected function sort()
        {
        }
    }

> **Note**
>
> Private class methods, and properties, should be avoided unless
> absolutely necessary as they present difficulties when writing unit
> tests.

Constants
---------

Constants should always be all-uppercase, with underscores to separate
words. Prefix constant names with the uppercase name of the
class/package they are used in. For example, the constants used by the
JError class all begin with "JERROR\_".

Global Variables
----------------

Do not use global variables. Use static class properties or constants
instead of globals.

Regular Variables and Class Properties
--------------------------------------

Regular variables, follow the same conventions as function.

Class variables should be set to null or some other appropriate default
value.

Exception Handling
==================

Exceptions should be used for error handling.

The follow sections outline how to semantically use [SPL
exceptions](http://php.net/manual/en/spl.exceptions.php).

Logic Exceptions
----------------

The LogicException is used when there is an explicit problem with the
way the API is being used. For example:

A dependency has failed (you try to operate on an object that has not
been loaded yet).
The following child classes can also be used in appropriate situations.

### BadFunctionCallException

This exception can be thrown if a callback refers to an undefined
function or if some arguments are missing. For example:

is\_callable
, or similar, fails on a function.
### BadMethodCallException

This exception can be thrown if a callback refers to an undefined method
or if some arguments are missing. For example:

is\_callable
, or similar, fails on a class method.
Arguments passed to a magic call method are missing.
### InvalidArgumentException

This exception can be called if there is invalid input.

### DomainException

This exception is similar to the InvalidArgumentException but can be
thrown if a value does not adhere to a defined valid data domain. For
example:

Trying to load a database driver of type "mongodb" but that driver is
not available in the API.
### LengthException

This exception can be thrown is a length check on an argument fails. For
example:

A file signature was not a specific number of characters.
### OutOfRangeException

This exception has few practical applications but can be thrown when an
illegal index was requested.

Runtime Exceptions
------------------

The RuntimeException is thrown when some sort of external entity or
environment causes a problem that is beyond your control providing the
input is valid. This exception is the default case for when the cause of
an error can't explicitly be determined. For example:

Tried to connect to a database but the database was not available
(server down, etc).
An SQL query failed.
### UnexpectedValueException

This type of exception should be used when an unexpected result is
encountered. For example:

A function call returned a string when a boolean was expected.
### OutOfBoundsException

This exception has few practical applications but may be thrown if a
value is not a valid key.

### OverflowException

This exception has few practical applications but may be thrown when you
add an element into a full container.

### RangeException

This exception has few practical applications but may be thrown to
indicate range errors during program execution. Normally this means
there was an arithmetic error other than under/overflow. This is the
runtime version of DomainException.

### UnderflowException

This exception has few practical applications but may thrown when you
try to remove an element of an empty container.

Documenting exceptions
----------------------

Each function or method must annotate the type of exception that it
throws using an @throws tag and any downstream exceptions types that are
thrown. Each type of exception need only be annotated once. No
description is necessary.

SQL Queries
===========

SQL keywords are to be written in uppercase, while all other identifiers
(which the ex-ception of quoted text obviously) is to be in lowercase.

All table names should use the \#\_\_ prefix rather than jos\_ to access
Joomla contents and allow for the user defined database prefix to be
applied. Queries should also use the JDatabaseQuery API.

    // Get the database connector.
    $db = JFactory::getDBO();

    // Get the query from the database connector.
    $query = $db->getQuery(true);

    // Build the query programatically (using chaining if desired).
    $query->select('u.*')
        // Use the qn alias for the quoteName method to quote table names.
        ->from($db->qn('#__users').' AS u'));

    // Tell the database connector what query to run.
    $db->setQuery($query);

    // Invoke the query or data retrieval helper.
    $users = $db->loadObjectList();
