  <para>One of the things that sets good software apart from great software is
  not the features or the actual function the software performs, but it more
  often than not balances on the quality of the source code. In order to
  perform in the highly competitive Open Source and propriety software
  industries, the source code not only needs to be beautifully de-signed, it
  also needs to be beautiful and elegant to look at.</para>

  <para>Readable code is maintainable code and the compass guides us in
  achieving that goal is by developing and adhering to a set of well thought
  out coding standards for the different software languages that are employed
  in a software project. Joomla has a solid heritage of striving to support a
  great looking product with great looking code. This document compiles the
  collective wisdom of past and present contributors to the project to form
  the definitive standard for coding in Joomla, whether that is for the core
  Joomla Platform or an extension that forms part of the stack of the Joomla
  CMS. It also serves as a lighthouse to the Joomla developer community, to
  safely guide developers around the pitfalls of becoming lackadaisical with
  respect to writing clean, beautiful code.</para>

  <para>The Joomla Coding Standards borrows heavily from the PEAR coding
  standard for PHP files, augmenting and diverging where it is deemed sensible
  to do so</para>
